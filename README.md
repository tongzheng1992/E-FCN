# E-FCN

This is the avaiable code for the paper ["Evidential fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13544) (arXiv:2103.13544).

Codes for Dempster-Shafer layer, pignistic transformation layer and utility layer are in the file "libs".

The file "E-Unet.ipynb" provides a demo about how to build, train, and interfere precise and imprecise segmantation with evidential FCN models.

The file "weights_zoo" includes the parameters of two trained evidential FCN models that are used in the demo.

The required libraries and their version:

python == 3.7.10

tensorflow == 2.4.1.
